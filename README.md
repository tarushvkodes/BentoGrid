# Bento Grid

Bento Grid is a simple web project that demonstrates a grid layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

```

```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the grid layout.
2. Modify `script.js` to add functionality to the grid items.
3. Customize the styles in `styles.css` to change the appearance of the grid.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the grid.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the grid.
